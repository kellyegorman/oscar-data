##Explanation

This repository contains code from my final project for an introductory Data Science course. In this project, I worked with a group to analyze Oscar data to determine predictive qualities. I also included my final report and analysis for a more in-depth explanation of our processes.

After the conclusion of this project, I made some revisions to existing issues and added additional visualizations.
